# object_detection
This ROS 2 package estimates the distance of a blue-colored object using OpenCV and the pinhole camera model. It detects the object, measures its pixel width, and calculates distance based on a known focal length. Accurate for objects 17–20 cm wide, ideal for basic robot vision and distance-sensing tasks.
